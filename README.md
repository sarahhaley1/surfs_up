Through the analyzing the summary statistics on the months of June and Decemeber, for the difference in seasonal weather, it will help provide a clearer insight as to whether or not opening up a surf / ice cream shop will be negatively impacted by weather depending on the season. 

### Results 

Three key differences in the weather statistical description between June and December are
  - The difference in minimum temperatures
    - In June the minimum temperature is said to be 64 degrees F, which is 8 degrees warmer than the    December minimum at 53 degrees F. This tells us that the low temperature days in december are going to have more negative impact on the surf / ice cream shop due to the cold weather. 
    
  - The difference in the 25% quartile
     - In June the lower quartile value is 73 degrees F, while in December the lower quartile value is 69 degrees F. This further tells us that the winter season is going to have a more negative mpact on the shop due to the low temperatures. With 25% of the vlaues being less than 69 degrees F on Oahu in December, it shows the investor that there are going to be some days in the winter where the shop struggles. 
  
  - The difference in the count
    - The number of temperatures recorded for the month of December over the years being less than the count for June is troubling for our data because the December months are the ones we are particularly more concerned aobut. Although there is still a large data set to analyze, there are days that could have an impact on the data that are missing.
